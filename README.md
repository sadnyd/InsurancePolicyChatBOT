This app users to upload PDF files, store them in a vector database, and query the stored content using gemini flash 2.0 LLM model. The API processes PDF files by extracting text, splitting it into semantic chunks, generating embeddings, and then storing them in a vector store for later querying.

## Features
- **PDF Upload**: Upload a PDF to be processed and stored in a vector database.
- **Query the Vector Store**: Submit a query to search for relevant content within the stored PDF chunks using gemini LLM (Large Language Model) for contextual answers.
